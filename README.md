# Coral Metabarcoding Analysis
This repository contains scripts used to analyse coral-associated bacterial communities
based on 16S rRNA gene (V5–V6 region) metabarcoding data.

## Study System
- Coral species: Acropora tenuis, Acropora verweyi, Stylophora pistillata
- Study area: Shimoni, South Coast of Kenya (Coral restoration site by REEFolution Foundation)
- Marker: 16S rRNA (V5–V6)
- Pipeline: DADA2 and R

## Repository Contents
